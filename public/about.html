<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, My name is Jacob Schaffer I am 22 years old and have been married for two years and I have an awesome son named Davie. I also have 2 Golden doodles name Mable and Otis as well as a Siamese cat named Gus. I live in Cullman, AL and have my whole life.
  I currnetly work for R.E. Garrison Trucking in afterhours dispatch and I am looking for a carreer change.
  The trucking industry is the heartbeat of America but I do not think it is the right path for me. .</p>

<p> A few of my hobbies include playing video games just about every night. Some games I am interested in are Call of Duty, Battlefield, No Man's Sky, Minecraft, and Forza Horizon 5.
  I also enjoy watching Basketball and Football. My favorite teams are Alabama in NCAAF, Kentucky in NCAAM, Baltimore Ravens in NFL, Boston Celtics in NBA.
  My favorite hobby of them all is spending time with my awesome family. I come from a very close family and see my parents almost every day.

<p> One of the reasons I decided to go into Web Development was the oppertunity to really reap the benefits of what I create.
  If I create a practical website that makes everybody's life easier it makes me feel good about the work I am doing.
  My brother-in-law is a software developer, and we were talking about what a normal day consist of in this field. Using problem-solving skills and having to think about what I am doing just gets me excited.
  I have currently completed Computer Science 101 in Udemy and am now working on The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp course to really understand the basics of the Web Development world.
